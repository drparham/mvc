# MVC
Simple example of an MVC framework for PHP.
This is for educational purposes only. Although it could be used for a simple brochure site. Supports clean/pretty urls.

##This System supports Routing.
This system is pulling in [PHRoute - Fast request router for php](https://github.com/mrjgreen/phroute). check the package out for documentation on use case.

## Very simple Controllers.
     
You have the ability to create any Controllers you want, with any methods you want. As long as they extend `App\Core\Controller`.
This parent Controller class exposes a method for models, and views.

## Very simple views
Plain PHP view files, no templating system in place

## Eloquent Models. 
This system is pulling in Eloquent Models from the Laravel Framework.
